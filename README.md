# BarberBackend

A minimal Express.js backend for a barber shop scheduling system. It allows users to request appointments, and the barber to manage them (login, accept/reject). Appointments are 35 minutes long and cannot overlap.

## Features

- JWT-based authentication
- SQLite database (no external DB setup)
- Appointment conflict detection
- Built with TypeScript
